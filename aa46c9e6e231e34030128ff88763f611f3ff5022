      "message": "That\u0027s a good question. Some providers might only serve over SSL, in which case it doesn\u0027t matter for them. But some might serve other either protocol and Gerrit would need to pick the right one in the plugin based on what Gerrit is running under. :-(\n\nYou may be right that this needs to be made more easily available to a plugin. I\u0027m not sure I want this as a parameter to getUrl(). It seems more like something the plugin should learn in its constructor from some sort of server configuration object. Which is why I suggested this approach, however ugly it may be.",
